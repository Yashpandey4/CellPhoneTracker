# Mobile phone tracking system description
As we know each mobile phone that is switched on is connected to the base
station which is nearest. These base stations are popularly called cell phone
towers. Although sometimes we may be within range of more than one base
station, each phone is registered to exactly one base station at any point of
time. When the phone moves from the area of one base station to another,
it will be de-registered at its current base station and re-registered at new
base station.

### Making a phone call. 
When a phone call is made from phone p1 registered
with base station b1 to a phone p2, the rst thing that the base station b1
has to do is to nd the base station with which p2 is registered. For this
purpose there is an elaborate technology framework that has been developed
over time. You can read more about it on the Web. But, for now, we will
assume that b1 sends a query to a central server C which maintains a data
structure that can answer the query and return the name of the base station,
let's call it b2, with which p2 is registered. C will also send some routing
information to b1 so that b1 can initiate a call with b2 and, through the base
stations p1 and p2 can talk. It is the data structure at C that we will be
implementing in this assignment.
A hierarchical call routing structure. We will assume that geography
is partitioned in a hierarchical way. At the lowest level is the individual base
station which denes an area around it such that all phones in that area
are registered with it, e.g., all phones that are currently located in Bharti
building, School of IT and IIT Hospital are registered with the base station
in Jia Sarai. This base station also serves phone in Jia Sarai and maybe some
phones on Outer Ring Road in front of Jia Sarai. Further we assume that
base stations are grouped into geographical locations served by an level 1 area
exchange. So, for example, the Jia Sarai base station may be served by the
Hauz Khas level 1 area exchange. Each level i area exchange is served by a
level i+1 area exchange which serves a number of level i area exchanges, e.g.,
the Hauz Khas level 1 area exchange and the Malviya level 1 area exchange
may be both served by a South-Central Delhi level 2 area exchange. A base
station can be considered to be a level 0 area exchange in this hierarchical
structure. Given a level i exchange f, we say that the level i + 1 exchange
that serves it is the parent of f, and denote this parent(f).
We will call this hierarchical call routing structure the routing map of the
mobile phone network.

### Maintaining the location of mobile phones. 
Every level i area ex-change, e, maintains a set of mobile phones, Se, as follows. The set Se is
called the resident set of e. The level 0 area exchanges (base stations) main-
tain the set of mobile phones registered directly with them. A level i+1 area
exchange e, maintains the set Se defined as follows i.e., the union of the sets of mobile phones maintained by all the level i area
exchanges it serves.
Clearly, the root of the routing map maintains the set of all currently
registered mobile phones.

### Tracking a mobile phone. 
The routing map along with the resident sets
of each area exchange makes up the mobile phone tracking data structure we will be using. This data structure will be stored at the central server C. The
process of tracking goes as follows.
* When a base station b receives a call for a mobile phone with number
m it sends this query to C.
* If the root of the routing map is r, we first check if m belongs to Sr. If not then
we tell b that the number m is not reachable.
* If m belongs to Sr we find that e such that parent(e) = r and m belongs to Se, i.e. we
find the child of r which contains m in its resident set.
* Continue like this till we reach all the way down to a leaf of the routing
map. This leaf is a base station b0. The central server sends b0 to b
along with the path in the routing map from b to b_0.
